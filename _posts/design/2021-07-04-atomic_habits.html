I have been wanting to read this book for quite sometime now, and finally got my hands on it. 

The following were the main ideas from the Book. There is no substitute to physically holding a book and reading it fully and I'd always prefer that than just reading the summary. 


**Atomic Habits is a book on how small habits can change peoples lives. Do you know why you brush your teeth first thing in the morning or atleast in the first few minutes in the morning? That's because you started it as a Habit when you were a kid and it just stuck with you as you grew up**

Atomic Habits is about that, its about how tiny habits shape your lives.

What was particularly enjoyable about the book is how the author touched upon various other aspects of life through the power of habits. For example, without spilling out the essence of the book, let me share some insights from the book that I thoroughly enjoyed. 


#### Chapter 1 - The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits

  - **Habits** are the compound interest of self-improvement. Getting 1 percent better every day counts for a lot in the long-run. Small changes often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold. The most powerful outcomes of any compounding process are delayed. You need to be patient. If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead. You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.


#### In Chapter 2, the author covers how your habits Shape Your Identity. In Particular, he talks about change.
  - Change can occur in 3 ways - outcome change, process change, and identity change. The most effective way to change your habits is to focus not on what you want to achieve, but on who you wish to become. Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity.


#### In Chapter 3, the author shows you how to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps and shows you the 4 laws of change. 

  - A habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to become automatic. The ultimate purpose of habits is to solve the problems of life with as little energy and effort as possible.


#### In Chapters 4 to 6, the author covers how habits become second nature and how to start one.

   - With enough practice, your brain will pick up on the cues that predict certain outcomes without consciously thinking about it. Once our habits become automatic, we stop paying attention to what we are doing.
  
  
  **The interesting aspect about compounding (which most consider to be the 8th Wonder of the world) is that it has its downsides if not done rightly, which the author talks about in chapters 7 and 8**
  
    
#### Chapter 7 - The Secret to self control and how to make habits irresistable

  - Once a habit is formed, it is unlikely to be forgotten. People with high self-control tend to spend less time in tempting situations. The more attractive an opportunity is, the more likely it is to become habit-forming. Habits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop. When dopamine rises, so does our motivation to act.


In the remaining Chapters, the author covers how the environment you are in plays a role in the habits you build and your routine and ways to fix habits that don't provide good results. Reading such ideas not only motivates you to change your routine but also pushes you to stick with it for the long run which the author has shared in Chapter 12 and 13 on how to stop procrastinating and build good habits. 

Not to forget, Good habits has its downsides which has been neatly described by the author in the final chapter of the book. 

Honestly, there are no negatives i see in this book. Picking up this book and reading it on a weekend is one of the biggest reading investments you can ever make.
